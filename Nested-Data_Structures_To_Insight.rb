# Nested Data Structures to Insights
# By applying code to NDS, we can synthesize insights from the raw facts contained in the NDS.

# Examples
# What's the average age of people in the NDS representing a class of students?
# How many pieces of candy are in this vending machine?
# In what year will most of my employees reach retirement age so I can plan 401K contributions

# NDS to Insight Strategy 
# 1. Understand the NDS 
#       "Pretty-Print" NDS with pp
#       Home-Grown Pretty-Print NDS 
# 2. Use [] to verify your understanding from Step 1 
#       Print values to verify your understand 
#       Leave code comments and documentation for yourself 
# 3. Wrap uses of [] from Step 2 into new methods 
#       create simple methods with meaningful names "First Order Method"
#       Ensure "First-Order Methods" use arguments to create flexibility
# 4. See-saw between bottom-up and top-down method writing
#       Write a method that provides an insight e.g. oldest_student
#       Evaluate your First Order Methods
#       Can you use your First-Order Methods to build the insight method's implementation?
#       YES: Great! Your method is done!
#       NO: Build a new method that combines other methods to get closer to what the insight method needs. Repeat step 4
# 5. Insight method provides an insight! We're done!
